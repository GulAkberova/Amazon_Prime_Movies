Jupyter Notebook Analysis
The analyses performed in Jupyter Notebook using Python include:

- Data Cleaning and preparation.
- Statistical analysis and exploration of distributions by genre, year, and city.
Visualizations:
- Using Seaborn and Matplotlib:
- Distribution by genre and rating.
- Trends of TV and Movie types over the years.

Power BI Dashboard
In the Power BI dashboard, the following visualizations were created:

- Field Map: Distribution by cities.
- Donut Chart: Distribution by TV and Movie types.
- Area Chart: Trends of TV and Movie types by years.
- Stacked Bar Chart: Distribution by genre and rating.
- Cards: Total counts of genres and ratings

Results
The project results show the distribution of Amazon Prime content by genre, rating, city, and years. Key findings include:

- Genre Distribution: Indicates which genres are more popular.
- Yearly Trends: Shows the increase or decrease of TV and Movie types over the years.
- City Distribution: Highlights the cities with the most Amazon Prime users.
- Overall Statistics: Shows total counts of ratings and genres, highlighting the most highly-rated genres.
